Project Proposal: Using Google Maps Data to Get Insights Into Private Travel Habits

Introduction and Motivation
When first starting this project, I wasn’t sure which topic to pick. But one day, after commuting back and forth from school and getting stuck in traffic, I thought it would be interesting to analyze my own travel patterns. Google Maps offers a feature called Timeline, which records a user’s travel history, including visited locations, travel routes, and frequency. This project aims to extract and visualize insights from my Google Maps data.

Hypothesis
I believe I travel more on weekdays compared to weekends, likely due to my school schedule and daily errands.

Objectives
Extract travel history data from Google Maps Timeline.
Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
Examine travel habits, including frequently visited locations, preferred routes, and modes of transportation.
Visualize travel trends using charts and graphs.
Methodology
1. Data Collection
Download Google Maps Timeline data via Google Takeout.
Extract relevant details (timestamps, locations, and modes of transportation).
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and standardize the raw data for analysis.
Handle missing or inconsistent entries.
3. Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Identify trends in travel frequency, locations, and timing.
Measure distances traveled, average speed, and transportation preferences.
Machine Learning Integration:
Predict future travel habits, such as the estimated distance traveled per day.
4. Visualization
Use Matplotlib to create detailed visualizations.
Map travel paths and highlight frequently visited locations.
5. Reporting and Insights
Present findings in a detailed report with visual aids.
Offer actionable recommendations for optimizing travel habits.
Expected Outcomes
A comprehensive understanding of personal travel habits.
Visual representations of spatial and temporal travel patterns.
Insights into transportation choices and travel efficiencies.
Predictive models to forecast future travel patterns.
A structured approach for others to analyze their own travel data.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: json, pandas, datetime, google.colab, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib
Data Source: Google Maps Timeline (via Google Takeout)
Challenges and Limitations
Ensuring data privacy and security throughout the project.
Addressing gaps or inconsistencies in Google Maps Timeline data.
Handling incomplete or missing trip records.
